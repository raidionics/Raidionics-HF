## [Brief intro](https://github.com/raidionics/Raidionics-HF#brief-intro)

This web application enables users to easily test our deep learning models for preoperative central nervous system tumor segmentation.
The plugin is built on top of gradio using the same backend as used for the [Raidionics](https://raidionics.github.io/) software.
Raidionics is an open-source, free-to-use desktop application for pre- and postoperative central nervous system tumor segmentation and standardized reporting.

## [Demo](https://github.com/raidionics/RaidionicsHF#demo) <a target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dbouget/raidionics"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-yellow.svg"></a>

To access the live demo, click on the `Hugging Face` badge above. Below is a snapshot of the current state of the demo app.

## [Development](https://github.com/raidionics/RaidionicsHF#development)

### [Docker](https://github.com/raidionics/RaidionicsHF#docker)

Alternatively, you can deploy the software locally. Note that this is only relevant for development purposes. Simply dockerize the app and run it:

```
docker build -t RaidionicsHF .
docker run -it -p 7860:7860 RaidionicsHF
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your favourite internet browser to view the demo.

### [Python](https://github.com/raidionics/RaidionicsHF#python)

It is also possible to run the app locally without Docker. Just setup a virtual environment and run the app.
Note that the current working directory would need to be adjusted based on where `Raidionics-HF` is located on disk.

```
git clone https://github.com/raidionics/Raidionics-HF.git
cd Raidionics-HF/

virtualenv -python3 venv --clear
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py --cwd ./
```

## [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/raidionics/RaidionicsHF#troubleshooting)

Due to `share=True` being enabled by default when launching the app,
internet access is required for the app to be launched. This can disabled by setting
the argument to `--share 0`.
